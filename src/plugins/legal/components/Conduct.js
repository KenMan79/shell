    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <i>The following rules should be followed at ALL TIMES when you are participating in the CTF. By using this site you
        agree to adhere to these terms unconditionally, violation of these terms may result in your access being revoked
        and/or your account terminated. Really Awesome CTF reserves the right to terminate accounts or revoke any access
        rights at the admin's discretion, without any warning or prior notice.</i>

    <ul>
        <li>Attacking anything other than the provided targets is out of scope. We are monitoring the CTF closely and
            will revoke access of anyone appearing to be attempting to attack the scoreboard, other participants, or the
            infrastructure beyond the provided targets.</li>
        <li>Purposeful attempts to disrupt the CTF, hack unintended systems, or hack other participants will result in
            immediate termination of your Really Awesome CTF account.</li>
        <li>The challenge briefings will provide you with the endpoints you are permitted to target. To complete the
            challenge you do not need to target anything outside the provided endpoint. Do not attempt to hack
            anything other than the provided, specified targets. No challenge requires a container escape.</li>
        <li>If you are not sure if something you want to try is within scope, <b>*ASK first*</b> by DMing a Team Member
            on Discord.</li>
        <li>If you suspect something is broken or find a bug you want to report, please DM a Team Member on
            Discord.</li>
